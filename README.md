**Custom medicine search engine**

[liamjones.science](http://liamjones.science/search_gcse/#gsc.tab=0) hosts a custom search engine for medical topics designed to exclude result directed at lay audiences, and prioritise results directed at **medical professionals and students**. It uses Google's [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) to prioritise specific professional and student oriented resources. *For convenience, I suggest using an adblocker on your browser, as sponsored results defeat the purpose of the search engine.*


The current list of prioritised sites are:
* https://www.tg.org.au/ - Therapeutic guidelines
* https://tgldcdp.tg.org.au/  
* https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/
* https://www.cochranelibrary.com/
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov - Includes Statpearls
* https://litfl.com 
* https://amboss.com - Student resources
* https://osmosis.org - Student resources
* https://uptodate.com
* https://www.nps.org.au/ - NPS MedicineWise

The Current list of excluded sites are:
* https://kidshealth.org/
* https://www.mayoclinic.org/
* https://www.healthline.com/
* https://www.webmd.com/

**If you would like to suggest additional sites to be added to either list, or have any other feedback, submit them in the [issues](https://github.com/liamlah/Medicina-Technica/issues) section.**
